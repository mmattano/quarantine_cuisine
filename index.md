Matthias Mattanovich 2020/2021

Some of these recipes were taken from other sources; I try to reference all of them.
It’s a work in progress and will be updated irregularly.
Everything is vegetarian and I’m trying to suggest suitable vegan alternatives as well.
I’m also working on a cost calculator atm that could be added on a website (or an excel sheet).

Feel free to submit suggestions.

If you don’t like the recipes, eat shit instead :D
